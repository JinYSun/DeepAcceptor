    "It is a time-consuming and costly process to develop affordable and high-performance organic photovoltaic materials. Developing reliable computational methods to predict the power conversion efficiency (PCE) is crucial to triage unpromising molecules in large-scale databases and accelerate the material discovery process. In this study, a deep learning-based framework (DeepAcceptor) has been built to design and discover high-efficient small molecule acceptor materials. Specifically, an experimental dataset was constructed by collecting data from publications. Then, a BERT-based model was customized to predict PCEs by taking fully advantages of the atom, bond, connection information in molecular structures of acceptors, and this customized architecture is termed as abcBERT. The computation molecules and experimental molecules were used to pre-train and fine-tune the model, respectively. The molecular graph was used as the input and the computation molecules and experimental molecules were used to pretrain and finetune the model, respectively. \n",
    "DeepAcceptor is a promising method to predict the PCE and speed up the discovery of high-performance acceptor materials."

    "First, the  masked language model (MLM) task  was chosen as the SMILES was converted into molecular graph by using RDKit. Then, a supernode was added, which was made to connected to all the atoms in a molecule. A mask atoms model was used to pretrain the model similar to MLM task in NLP. As shown in Figure 1, the pretrained model consisting of the embedding layer, transformer encoder layers and classification layers was used to predict the masked atoms. The computational molecules were represented as embeddings including word token embeddings and positional embeddings. Then the embedding was used as the input of transformer encoder layers. Specifically, 15% of the atoms in a molecule were randomly selected, and these atoms have an 80% probability of being represented as [MASK], 10% probability of being replaced by other atoms and 10% probability of keeping unchanged. In pretraining stage, the classification linear layers were added to the transformer encoder layers and used to predict the masked atoms. The original molecules were used as the truth to train the model and predict the types of masked atoms."
