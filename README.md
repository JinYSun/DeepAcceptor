# DeepAcceptor

### **Computational design and screening of acceptor materials for organic solar cells**

![workflow](workflow.jpg)

## <u>Motivation</u>

It is a time-consuming and costly process to developing affordable and high-performance organic photovoltaic materials. Developing reliable computational methods to predict the power conversion efficiency (PCE) is crucial to triage unpromising molecules in large-scale database and accelerate the material discovery process. In this study, a deep-learning based framework (DeepAcceptor) has been built to design and discover high-efficient small molecule acceptor materials. Specifically, an experimental dataset was built by collecting data from publications. Then, a BERT-based model was used to predict PCEs. The molecular graph was used as the input and the computation molecules and experimental molecules were used to pretrain and finetune the model, respectively. In sum, DeepAcceptor is a promising method to predict the PCE and speed up the discovery of high-performance acceptor materials.
